# Akan Name Generator Project
#### A website to maintain Ghanaian heritage by allowing users to input their name and date of birth to generate their Akan name, April 21, 2025
#### By **Joshua Karanja**

## Description
I built this website to help Ghanaians track and preserve the roots of their Akan names. The application allows users to input their date of birth, which is then used to generate their corresponding Akan name based on Ghanaian cultural traditions. Akan names are deeply rooted in the culture, with names given based on the day of the week a person is born. This project aims to promote and maintain Ghanaian heritage in a digital, accessible way.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* No extra installations are required.
* The application runs on a server.
* Simply clone the repository and run the application in your browser.

## Known Bugs
There are known issues with the JavaScript functionality. Currently, the script is not fully interactive, as it does not successfully integrate or display the generated Akan names after users input their date of birth. This limits the core functionality of the application.

### Workaround & Collaboration
This project is open for collaboration, and contributions are welcome to improve the interactivity and fix the JavaScript issues. Developers interested in helping are encouraged to fork the repository, work on the issue, and submit pull requests.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project was built using basic web technologies. The core structure and layout are handled using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity for generating Akan names based on user input.
